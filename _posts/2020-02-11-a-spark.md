>A single spark can start a prairie fire

Just 3 months ago, I was so called a 'Muggle' in programming. Then, I had a chance to get to learn my first programming language **Ruby** in Astro Camp, a full-stack coding bootcamp.

At the end of the day, we as a team have developed a task management web-based application(Clone Trello), and were able to demonstrate our capability in front of many others. Now, I've acquired the fundamental skills on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and I'm seeking an opportunity to become a onboard developer.

Things that I've learned the most other than coding is how to deal with frustrations, and how to do self-learning.

I would say this post is a spark, and is going to ignite everything in me. As long as I'm **DRY** enough.
