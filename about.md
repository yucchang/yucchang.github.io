Hi, I'm Yu Cheng. A guy always with big smile, and shorts plus Nike socks as a normal dresscode. (Aye...that's me in the pic trying to do some photosynthesis on a flower farm in Hokkaido.) 

I am now strive for learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript. So, this blog is defined as a learning log, as the one and only way I could think to push myself trully understand things about programming, and a way to explain to others. Hopefully, I can write at least 2 articles a week.
