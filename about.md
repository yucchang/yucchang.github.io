Hi, I'm Yu Cheng. A guy always with big smile, and shorts plus Nike socks as my normal dresscode. 

I'm learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript. This blog is a programming learning log which is the only way I could think to push myself truly understand everything about what I'm dealing with.

Peace.
